# AddressBook

This feature allows you to use short names when forming letters by third-party applications (currently, when using the SMTP protocol).

## Usage

First you need to fill in file addressbook.txt in pboted data directory (usually it is /var/lib/pboted).
For example:

```
# Each line is in the format: <alias>;<name>;<dest>;
#   alias = for replacement in SMTP (<user>@<domain>)
#   name = pupblic name of identity
#   dest = base64 public bote address
# The fields are separated by a semicolon character.
# Lines starting with a # are ignored.
# Do not edit this file while pboted is running as it will be overwritten.
