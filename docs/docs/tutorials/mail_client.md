# Configuring the mail client

_Tested with [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/)_

## SMTP

1. Turn on SMTP for [this](SMTP.md) instruction.
2. For default settings client side configuration looks like:

- Server name: localhost
- Port: 25
- Connection security: None
- Authentication method: No authentication
- User Name: username

## POP3

1. Turn on POP3 for [this](POP3.md) instruction.
2. For default settings client side configuration looks like:

- Server name: localhost
- Port: 110
- Connection security: None
- Authentication method: Password, transmitted insecurely

For now, you can use any password, as it will be ignored on the pboted side.
