# Protocol version 5 (DRAFT)

At the moment, PeerList packets of 5th version have been implemented to support current types of I2P destination.   
PeerList packets of 4th version are supported, older Java nodes respond but do not send requests due to protocol restrictions at DSA I2P destinations.
You can see the implementation details in this section.

Proposals for improving the 5th version of the protocol are accepted for consideration.
